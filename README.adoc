= About

This repository is a simple proof of concept around https://htmx.org[HTMX], and since it can be linked to a backend, I chose https://www.rust-lang.org/[Rust] as its language of choice.

= Objectives

- Learn HTMX with a concrete, ideally non-trivial use-case
- Improve my "business" Rust
- Have fun !
